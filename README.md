This repository holds the web development project i did during my second year of my software engineer education

In hindsight this project was quite messy due to all the requirements it needed to have in order to pass the course and i would like to redo it without all the clutter and while actually using a javascript framework.
Therefore i will archive this project as is and start a new and improved version which will be the actual release and worth of a spot in my portfolio.

Running this is quite straightforward as it basically only uses ASP.NET so if you open it up in either rider or visual studio it should just work once run is clicked
